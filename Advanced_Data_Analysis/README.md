# Divvy Bike Analysis
This was a final project for my Advanced Data Analysis course where we had to use various analytical techniques for this regression problem to understand the charteristics of Divvy riders. This was a group project so special thanks to Isra Abuhasna, Aramide Kehinde, Yufan Hu, Rebecca Holloway on working on this project.
